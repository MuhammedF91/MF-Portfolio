## ðŸ“– About This Portfolio

This GitHub repository is a curated summary of my hands-on DevOps experience, where I applied real-world tools and workflows across several self-hosted projects.

ðŸ”§ I created this portfolio to:
- Document the DevOps tools Iâ€™ve used and mastered
- Showcase real implementations (without exposing source code)
- Track my growth and learning journey in the DevOps field
- Provide recruiters and technical teams with a clear view of my practical capabilities

ðŸ§  From deploying Dockerized microservices on a Raspberry Pi to setting up CI/CD pipelines, VPN access with WireGuard, and reverse proxying via Nginx â€” everything here reflects my applied knowledge and troubleshooting experience.

ðŸ“Œ No project source code is shared here to keep things clean and focused on implementation strategies and tool usage.
